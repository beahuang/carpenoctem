			<h2>Hospital</h2>
			<p id="hp">
				You arrive at the hospital to bring your mom her reading glasses which she left at home 
				when you stumble upon an infected guy in the waiting room and you both start having conversation. 
				Before leaving, your mom gives you a mini first aid pocket kit and tells you to “be safe out there”.
			</p>
			<!-- 		can't go here but leaving it in -->
			<p id="ip-hp">
				You decide to get a few drinks so you head over to the local Irish Pub. You drink so much vodka 
				and tequila you feel like you’re superman!
			</p>
			<p id="pk-hp" class='mom'>
				Feeling scared and not knowing what to do, you decide you should ask your mom what to do with the backpack, whom is on call in radiology. She advises you to keep it as it is “crazy out there”. She also gives you a pocket first aid kit as she is always paranoid for your safety.

			<p id="cs-hp" class='mom'>
				You go to the hospital to bring your mom, who is on call in radiology, some of the sweet coffee you bought. She thanks you and gives you a pocket first aid kit because she is always paranoid about your safety.

			<p id="ps-hp">
				While talking with the prisoner, he mentions he last saw his mom 2 years ago. This saddens 
				you and you decide to head to the hospital to say hello to your mom, who is on call in radiology.
			</p>
			<p id="ps-pk-hp">
				You go to the Hospital to get your wound checked out and cleaned up. You need a little pick me up so 
				you sneak onto the roof, smoke weed, look at stars and get existential.
			</p>
			<p id="hp-pk-hp" class='nurse'>
			Luckily, there was a nearby spectator of the stabbing who calls an ambulance for you. You are sent to the hospital, where they determine that the wound was not deep and that you would be fine. They stitch you up and recommend some rest.
			</p>
			<p id="ip-cs-hp" class='kid'>
				You tell your new friend about your favorite spot to smoke weed, and he’s all about it. The two of you sneak onto the roof of the hospital successfully and get super high, staring at the stars. You share the sandwich to fight off the munchies, and talk at length about the thin line between life and death.

				You drunkenly decide to make your night even better getting crossfaded. Your favorite smoking spot in the city is the roof of the hospital, just tall enough to see over the city and up to the stars. You sneak up successfully, smoke weed, look at stars, and get existential.

				You take some of the leftover chinese food to your mom, who is working an overnight shift in radiology. She thanks you, and tells you about the weird patient who came in earlier. He had a fever and totally incomprehensible vitals. You tell her not to worry about it, and she advises you to stay inside.

				You guys are having a great time when one of the guys you came with passes out and you all call an ambulance 
				for him. Since you feel responsible for this since you were the one who brought him drinks, you get in the 
				ambulance with another one of his friends. Once at the hospital, the nurses say he will be fine but he needs 
				to spend the night. You and his friend are relieved so you decide to blow off some steam and sneak onto the 
				roof, smoke weed, look at stars and get existential. And think about where this crazy night will lead you to 
				next.

				Your drunken flailing leads to you shooting yourself in the leg, so after throwing up in a nearby trashcan and dragging yourself to the front of the station, you call an ambulance on your cell. It picks you up in fifteen minutes and brings you to the hospital, where people are rushing around in a panic. As you are wheeled through the halls, you briefly glimpse another patient violently clawing at his nurse...

				While firing guns at the range; in your drunken state, you accidentally shoot yourself in the foot.
				You get to the hospital and they amputate your pinky toe, but other than that you are fine and dandy. 
				A lack of a pinky toe does not stop you from enjoying your night. You decide to sneak into the morgue to 
				check out some of the dead bodies, but you get locked in. You then start to freak out that you may be stuck 
				in here for the rest of the night. 30 minutes pass and one of the corpses sits up and starts to walk 
				towards you. You are still pretty drunk and impaired which results in you trying to fight off the zombie
				whom is now on top of you…

			<p id="ip-cs-ps-hp" class='end'>
				The two of you, having developed a taste for infiltrating service buildings, decide your next stop should be the hospital. You try to get into the morgue, but two people are a lot more noticeable than one, and you get stopped by hospital security. While they drill you about what the hell you thought you were doing, you hear groaning coming from the stairs down to the morgue. When you see what is clearly a zombie coming up the stairs, eyes bloodshot and mouth gaping, you ignore the shouted protests of the guard and shoot it down, between the two of you managing a single headshot. There are more screams coming from the other side of the hospital!

				The girl you’ve been following tells you to drop dead before retreating into a flat, and the expression plants an idea into your head. You decide to sneak into the hospital morgue, a place your doctor/mom never let you go, to indulge your fascination with death. Ten minutes in you realize you’ve been locked down there! Twenty more frantic minutes pass, whereupon you notice one of the corpses stirring...

				You two next decide that the hospital surely has some weird and exciting stuff to show you. So you try to get into the morgue, but two people are a lot more noticeable than one, and you get stopped by hospital security. While they drill you about what the hell you thought you were doing, you hear groaning coming from the stairs down to the morgue. When you see what is clearly a zombie coming up the stairs, eyes bloodshot and mouth gaping, you freak - you have nothing to defend yourself with! The security guard, thinking it’s just a patient, tries to talk to it until it’s too late, and he’s being mauled on the floor. You and your friend start running...
