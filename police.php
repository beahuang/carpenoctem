		<h2>Police Station</h2>
		<p id="ps">You witness a mugging and get a picture of the mugger on your phone. You get to the Police station and the officers are really busy, wave you off so you end up hanging out with a prisoner.

		The news report at the coffee shop freaked you out a little, so you decide to go to the police station for more information. They agree to send a couple of officers to check out the park, but the rest stay back to eat their chinese food and invite you to join them. You share your donuts with them and they share some of their sickest stories with you.</p>
		<p id="hp-ps">
		You go to the Police Station to relay the information from the patient about the zombie attack. The officers said they are already on it and invite you to eat some Chinese food. Enjoy crazy cop stories.

		You go to the police station to report the bag you have just found. The officers are eating Chinese food and invite you to join them as a token for your citizenship. Enjoy crazy cop stories.

		<p id="cs-ip-ps">You are so drunk that doing something insanely reckless entices you. So you decide to go to the police station to key some police cars. But then you notice most of the officers are gone, so you get an even better idea... you sneak into their firing range, pick up one of the standard-issue pistols, and start shooting (poorly) in the general direction of the targets, doing a lot of damage to the walls in the process.</p>
		
		<p id="hp-cs-ps">
		You are brought to the Police station and you are held in a cell. 2 hours pass while you are in your cell and you see a hoard of zombies break into the jail and devour the police officer. You are safe from the zombies in your cell. However, all you have with you are the clothes on your back, the bench you are sitting on and 2 packs of saltine crackers and coffee the officer gave you to sober up…

		In the back of the taxi, the two of you debate your first destination until you pass by the police station and you notice that the parking lot is completely empty of cop cars. They’re all out somewhere! You take this rare opportunity to get into the station and mess around at the firing range - each of you picks up a standard-issue pistol and gets some good shots in at the targets. You each get pretty good at aiming.

		You decide against your mom’s advice to report the backpack at the police station. You notice most of the officers are gone, so you get an even better idea, you sneak into their firing range and start blasting away with any gun you can get your hands on! While blasting away from the corner of your eye you see a horde of zombies coming at you. With your loaded gun, you start shooting away...

You suddenly hear a crash and a scream - the front of the station is being attacked by zombies! The guy from the pub lends you his switchblade and the two of you help the policemen fend off the monsters.		</p>

The officers bring you to the station, and you have nothing to offer them because the munchies made you eat the donuts. They’re writing you up before throwing you in their holding cell, but suddenly, all three of you hear screams.

		Before you head home to sleep off the painkillers, you go to the police station to file a report on your attacker. It’s been a pretty crappy night so far, and when you hear screams in the midst of giving your story, you know it’s about to get worse. The station is being attacked by zombies. The policemen pull their guns, but the monsters smell the blood from your wound and stumble straight for you!		</p>
